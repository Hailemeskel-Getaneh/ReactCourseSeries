This note takes about event handlers

   - you  can handle deiffrent events
   - at the time of calling the handler do not forget to not use () or parentesis
      the problem is that if you use a parentesis it will automatically applay everting inside the handler  or not wait until the event is performed.
   - declare the handler as fucntion using function keyword or const in functional component but no use of const or funtion keyword in class componet in declaring handler.

# -- BUT if it is class component , do not forget to use the this keyword but still no parentesis
