This program is after completing the following theoretical concepts

what is component - it is any thing inside a function or element of the website
  - App.jsx is also a component which contains other components 
  - there are two components 
      - Stateless function components - simple js function
                                     - it is easy to use and declared as function
                                     - it is recomended and does not use this keywod

    - stateful class component - uses class and extends the component class imported from react
                               - it must use the render(){ } to return the html inside it
                               - it uses this keyword and it is more complext to dell with it
                               - it uses states unlike functional componet
                               - it is more advanced

How to import and export components.
   There are two ways to export components these are :
            - export keyword - this can be use in many componets at one file and
                            - you must use the exact name to import as
                             import {a} from services.jsx so start with capital letter to name .
                             
            -export default key word - if one things founds to be exported
                            - you can import any using any name as you want .

And also we talked about folder structure in react inluding how the app.jsx ,  main.jsx and index.html are linked to gether to work as whole
